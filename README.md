## What is This?

In 2024, the committee of the computer club at the university of stirling decided to start a group project. After proposing several suggestions, we decided to build a 3D game engine. That's this project!

## Goals

* Explore the world of 3D graphics rendering
* Develop an engine based around the [entity component system (ECS)][ecs] paradime
* Collaborate on a medium-scale C++ project
* Learn the procedures and tooling used when building larger projects
* Build a platform that can act as a starting point for experimentation related to 3D graphics, games, or other emersive applications
